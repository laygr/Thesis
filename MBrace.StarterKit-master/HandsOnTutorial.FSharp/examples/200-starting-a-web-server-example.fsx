# Starting a WebServer on your MBrace cluster

> This example is from the [MBrace Starter Kit](https://github.com/mbraceproject/MBrace.StarterKit).

In this tutorial, you learn how to start a web server on your MBrace cluster that can introspect
into the cluster, schedule work, report on jobs and so on.

(** Now the overall specification of the server: *)
let webServerSpec () =
  choose
    [ GET >>= choose
                [ path "/" >>= OK "Welcome to the cluster" 
                  path "/cluster/workers" >>= getWorkersRequest
                  path "/cluster/logs" >>= getLogsRequest
                  pathScan "/cluster/job/%s" getJobRequest
                  pathScan "/cluster/submit/primes/%d" computePrimesRequest ]
      POST >>= choose
                [ path "/hello" >>= OK "Hello POST"
                  path "/goodbye" >>= OK "Good bye POST" ] ]

(** 
Now connect to the cluster: 
*)

let cluster = getCluster()

cluster.ShowProcesses()

(** Use this to inspect the endpoints we can bind to in the cluster. 
The code below is specific to MBrace.Azure where your code runs as part
of an Azure worker role.  

> Note: If using a locally simulated MBrace.Thespian cluster then you need to adjust this example to use an appropriate endpoint IP address.

*)
let endPointNames = 
    cloud { return Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime.RoleEnvironment.CurrentRoleInstance.InstanceEndpoints.Keys |> Seq.toArray }
    |> cluster.Run

(**
By default, MBrace.Azure clusters created using the Azure CustomCloudService allow us to bind to 

* HTTP endpoint 'DefaultHttpEndpoint'
* HTTP endpoint 'MBraceStats'
* TCP endpoint 'DefaultTcpEndpoint'

Here we bind to DefaultHttpEndpoint.  
*)
let serverJob = suaveServerInCloud "DefaultHttpEndpoint" webServerSpec |> cluster.CreateProcess

(**
After you start the webserver (by binding to this internal endpoint), the website will 
be published to the corresponding public endpoint. You can find the IP
address or URL for the public endpoint by looking for 'Input Endpoints'
in the 'Configuration' section of the Azure management console page for the 
Cloud Service for the MBrace cluster.

For example, the public URL for the MBraceWorkerRole may be http://191.233.103.54:80
*)


(** Use this to inspect the status of the web server job: *) 
serverJob.ShowInfo()

(** If the webserver doesn't start, then use this to see the logging output from webserver.fsx: *) 

serverJob.ShowLogs()

(** Use this to cancel the web server (via the distributed cancellationToken being cancelled): *)
// serverJob.Cancel()

(** Use this to wait for the web server to exit after cancellation: *)
// serverJob.Result

(**
In this tutorial, you've learned how to start a web server on an MBrace cluster which can respond
to requests, control the cluster, access storage and so on.
Continue with further samples to learn more about the MBrace programming model.   

> Note, you can use the above techniques from both scripts and compiled projects. To see the components referenced

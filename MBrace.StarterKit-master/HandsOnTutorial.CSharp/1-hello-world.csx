// Note: Before running, choose your cluster version at the top of this script.
// If necessary, edit AzureCluster.csx to enter your connection strings.

// IMPORTANT:
// Before running this tutorial, make sure that you install binding redirects to FSharp.Core
// on your C# Interactive executable. To do this, find "InteractiveHost.exe" in your Visual Studio 2015 Installation.
// From your command prompt, enter the following command:
//
//   explorer.exe /select, %programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\PrivateAssemblies\InteractiveHost.exe
//
// Find the file "config/InteractiveHost.exe.config" that is bundled in the C# tutorial folder and place it next to InteractiveHost.exe.
// Now, reset your C# Interactive session. You are now ready to start using your C# REPL.

# Your First 'Hello World' Computation with MBrace

> This tutorial is from the[MBrace Starter Kit](https://github.com/mbraceproject/MBrace.StarterKit).

A guide to creating a cluster is [here](http://www.mbrace.io/#try).

Start C# Interactive in Visual Studio [navigate to View/Other Windows/C# Interactive].
In order to execute a piece of code in the REPL, copy and paste it to the interactive window.
The command below connects to the cluster; if you are using a locally simulated cluster it also creates the cluster.

*/

var cluster = Config.GetCluster();

/**

Next, get details of the workers in your cluster.Again, highlight the text below and
execute it in your scripting client:

*/

cluster.ShowWorkers();

/** Now execute your first cloud workflow, returning a handle to the running job: */

var workflow = CloudBuilder.FromFunc(() => "Hello, World!");
var task = cluster.CreateProcess(workflow);

/**

This submits a task to the cluster.To get details for the task, execute the
following in your scripting client: 

*/

task.ShowInfo();

/**

Your task is likely complete by now.To get the result returned by your
task, execute the following in your scripting client: 
    
*/

var text = task.Result;

/**

Alternatively we can do this all in one line: 
    
*/

var quickText = cluster.Run(CloudBuilder.FromFunc(() => "Hello, World!"));

/**

To check that you are running in the cloud, compare a workflow running locally
with one using cloud execution. (Note, if using an MBrace.Thespian locally simulated
cluster, these will be identical.) 
    
*/

var testWorkflow = CloudBuilder
    .FromFunc(() => Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!"))
    .OnSuccess(() => Environment.MachineName);

var localResult = cluster.RunLocally(testWorkflow);
var remoteResult = cluster.Run(testWorkflow);

/**

## Controlling the Cluster

To view the history of processes, execute the following line from your script

*/

cluster.ShowProcesses();

/**

In case you run into trouble, you can clear all process records in the cluster
by executing the following from your scripting client:

*/

cluster.ClearAllProcesses();
